## Tips to use this repository

Ideally the repo can be cloned onto the system to substitute local directories to keep resources from the semester

Command to clone 

`` git clone https://github.com/fromtimeimportsleep/Sem5 ``

You can then add your own directories for electives and maintain everything in the same directory

Make sure to ``git pull`` now and then to get updates :)
